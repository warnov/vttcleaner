# VTTCleaner

VTTCleaner is a Python console application designed to process both VTT files generated by Microsoft Teams and plain text transcripts copied from Word (Teams transcript format). It extracts and simplifies speaker interactions, making transcripts much more compact and suitable for use with Large Language Models (LLMs) by drastically reducing the required number of tokens.


## Features

- Removes unnecessary metadata and timestamps from VTT files.
- Supports processing of plain text transcripts copied from Word (Teams transcript format).
- Simplifies speaker names to "FirstName + Initial".
- Groups consecutive lines from the same speaker.
- Outputs a clean, compact transcript.


## Why use this?

Microsoft Teams VTT transcripts contain a lot of metadata and verbose speaker tags. Teams transcripts copied from Word are also verbose and not LLM-friendly. This tool cleans up both formats, making transcripts much easier and cheaper to process with LLMs (like GPT, Claude, etc.), as it reduces the token count significantly.


## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Choose the input format when prompted:
   - Enter `1` for a VTT file
   - Enter `2` for a plain text file copied from Word (Teams transcript)
3. Enter the path to your file when prompted.
