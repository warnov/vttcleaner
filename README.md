# VTTCleaner

VTTCleaner is a Python console application designed to process VTT files generated by Microsoft Teams transcriptions. It extracts and simplifies speaker interactions, making transcripts much more compact and suitable for use with Large Language Models (LLMs) by drastically reducing the required number of tokens.

## Features

- Removes unnecessary metadata and timestamps.
- Simplifies speaker names to "FirstName + Initial".
- Groups consecutive lines from the same speaker.
- Outputs a clean, compact transcript.

## Why use this?

Microsoft Teams VTT transcripts contain a lot of metadata and verbose speaker tags. This tool cleans up the transcript, making it much easier and cheaper to process with LLMs (like GPT, Claude, etc.), as it reduces the token count significantly.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Enter the path to your VTT file when prompted.
